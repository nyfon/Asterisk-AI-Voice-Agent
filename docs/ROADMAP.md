# Roadmap

## Vision

Asterisk AI Voice Agent (AAVA) aims to be the definitive open-source AI voice agent platform for Asterisk/FreePBX. We're building toward a world where any organization can deploy intelligent, natural voice agents on their existing phone infrastructure — with full control over privacy, cost, and provider choice.

### Active Milestones

| # | Milestone | Status | Skills | Difficulty | Details |
|---|-----------|--------|--------|------------|---------|
| 22 | Outbound Campaign Dialer | Alpha (hardening) | Python, ARI, React | Advanced | [Spec](contributing/milestones/milestone-22-outbound-campaign-dialer.md) |

Outbound dialer shipped as Alpha in v5.0.0 — core scheduling, AMD, voicemail drop, consent gate, and Admin UI are working. Current focus: DNC, retry automation, outcome classification, and resilience hardening (see Phases 6-8 in spec).

### v6.5.0 — Local AI Performance & Polish

| Feature | Description | Key Files | Effort |
|---------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| **Local LLM Token Streaming (WebSocket)** | Server emits `llm_token` messages for pipeline `local_llm` adapter. Currently `_handle_llm_request()` in `local_ai_server/server.py` ignores `stream: true` and returns one `llm_response`. Wiring `process_llm_chat_streaming()` into the WS handler + setting `supports_streaming = True` on `LocalLLMAdapter` would give pipeline-mode users the same sentence-by-sentence overlap that full-mode already has. | `local_ai_server/server.py:5498` (WS handler), `src/pipelines/local.py:979` (adapter) | Medium (3-4h) |
| **Concurrent LLM+TTS Producer/Consumer** | In `_process_full_pipeline_streaming()` (`server.py:5067`), `await self.process_tts()` blocks the token loop ~200-800ms per sentence. Refactor into two `asyncio.create_task` — producer consumes tokens and pushes sentences to a queue, consumer synthesizes and emits. Needs backpressure and `_llm_lock` coordination. Marginal gain on CPU but significant with faster LLMs (GPU/remote). | `local_ai_server/server.py:5067-5187` | Medium (3-4h) |
| **Speculative LLM on Stable Partials** | Start LLM inference speculatively when STT partial transcript is stable >300ms with 5+ words. If final matches → use cached result (saves 300-1500ms). If not → discard and run fresh. Config-stubbed (`speculative_llm_enabled` etc. in `local_ai_server/config.py:154-157`). Requires `_llm_lock` coordination and session state for speculative results. Only benefits streaming STT backends (Vosk, Sherpa, Kroko) — not Whisper. | `local_ai_server/config.py:154`, `local_ai_server/server.py` (new), `local_ai_server/session.py` (new fields) | High (6-8h) |
| **Comfort Noise Injection** | Replace digital silence with low-level telephony comfort noise (~-40dB) during processing gaps (between STT final and first TTS audio). Pre-generate 1 second of µ-law noise at startup, inject into `StreamingPlaybackManager` when buffer is empty. Config-stubbed (`comfort_noise_enabled` in `local_ai_server/config.py:166`). Cosmetic improvement — filler audio already addresses the biggest UX gap. | `src/core/streaming_playback_manager.py`, `local_ai_server/config.py:166` | Low (2h) |

## Future Vision

Longer-term goals that will shape the project's direction:

- **WebRTC Browser Client** — SIP client for browser-based calls without a physical phone
- **High Availability / Clustering** — Multi-instance `ai_engine` with session affinity and failover
- **Call Recording** — Consent-managed audio recording with storage backends (playback shipped in v6.3.2)
- **Multi-Language / i18n** — Dynamic language detection and provider switching per call (Russian backends shipped in v6.4.0)
- **Real-Time Dashboard** — Live visualization of active calls with metrics
- **Voice Biometrics** — Voice-based authentication for sensitive operations
- **Streaming Latency <500ms** — Performance optimizations for sub-500ms end-to-end latency
